# **WOOP - Women Out of Prison**

WOOP is an app that offers workshops and group therapy to women who have been released from prison. These services are provided by volunteers, including therapists and artists from various disciplines. 
Women who register can sign up for the services, view information about the different offerings, and gain skills through the activities they participate in. 
These skills can be used as a basis for recommendations to employers by tutors or social workers, helping with the reintegration of formerly incarcerated women into the workforce.
